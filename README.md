Huffman encoding requires multiple passes to go through the data, and may not be desirable if the data sequence is long. It also relies on the non-uniformity of data. 
Similarly Lempel Ziv algorithms also rely on the non-uniformity and repition of data. 

Drawbacks: 

* My algorithm needs to make two passes of the data in order to gauge how many elements there are.
