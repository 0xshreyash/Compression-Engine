* Each byte represents a symbol in the input sequence (each byte is a symbol)

* Constant access of a given symbol when the file is loaded into RAM. My understanding is that upon loading a file into the RAM we will not want to decompress the whole thing but use parts of it, which is why the constant access is important.

* Data is uniform i.e. all the symbols are nearly equally likely.
